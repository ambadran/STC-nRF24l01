# STC MCU nRF24l01 Interfacing

Allows any mc251-based STC MCU to easily read and write to/from nRF24l01. As well as providing all the other more advanced functions.

This library is built on `uni-stc` for Low-level hardware inits (SPI).

The nrf24l01 interfacing is mainly based on `ebrezadev` C implementation on Github, found in:
